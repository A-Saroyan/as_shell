These shell commands are defined internally.  

1. set
Allows creating or updating variables. If the user types set NAME=VALUE, as_shell adds or modifies that variable in your dictionary. 
If the user types set with no arguments, as_shell  lists all defined variables.

2. unset
Removes a named variable from  dictionary, so future expansions of $NAME produce empty or an error.

3. echo
Prints text, performing variable expansion on tokens that start with $. 
For example, echo hello $USER would replace $USER with that dictionary entry’s value.

4. pwd
Retrieves the as_shell’s known path for PWD and prints it.  

5. cd
Changes the as_shell’s idea of the current directory. 
 

6. help
Lists  as_shell’s available builtin commands and simple usage notes.

7. history
Displays previously entered commands. The as_shell internally stores up to 500 lines in a circular or ring buffer. 
By default, history can print all stored lines, or if history N is entered, print only the last N.

8. exit
Ends the main as_shell loop, typically returning control to the operating system.
