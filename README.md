# as_shell

as_shell is a simple imitation of a shell program, designed to mimic basic shell functionalities with minimal features.                                                                       
It's a lightweight, educational project that demonstrates the core concepts of shell interaction and command execution.                                                                  
Features                                                                                                
1.Builtin commands (e.g., pwd, cd, exit, set, unset, echo, help, history).             
2.Shell variables for tasks like set, unset, echo, and variable expansion ($VAR).                              
3.External command execution via process creation, searching directories in PATH or using direct pathnames.                                                       
4.A history feature that stores and can display the last 500 commands the user entered.
